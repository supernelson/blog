        <h3 class="title">Generation Passion</h3>
        <h4 class="headline">Should you be looking for passion or purpose?</h4>
        <p class="text">Millennials don't like to work. They just don't like to put it that way. They couch it as pursuing their passions. It's a new school of thought. It's working the problem backwards. Having your cake first. The risk involved is that you start with what you love and turn into a job you hate. You destroyed a passion.

        There may be confusion between passion and purpose.

        Passion is good but purpose it better. Passion evolves. Purpose is resolute.

        In business what is necessary is direction over love. Leave love for family and friends. Business is and has always been about making a living and providing a product or service.

        The valley that so many millennials will run into is the vicious reality of waking up at the age of 30 without any savings and any real job experience.
