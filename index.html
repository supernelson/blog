        <h4 class="headline">Should we be looking for passion or purpose?</h4>
        <h3 class="title">Call us generation passion.</h3>
        <p class="text">Millennials don't like to work. They just don't like to put it that way. They couch it as pursuing their passions. It's a new school of thought. It's working the problem backwards. Having your cake first. The risk involved is that you start with what you love and turn into a job you hate. You destroyed a passion.

        There may be confusion between passion and purpose.

        Passion is good but purpose it better. Passion evolves. Purpose is resolute.

        In business what is necessary is direction over love. Leave love for family and friends. Business is and has always been about making a living and providing a product or service.

        The valley that so many millennials will run into is the vicious reality of waking up at the age of 30 without any savings and any real job experience.

        <h3 class="title">Donald Trump is the White Kanye.</h3>
        <p class="text">The T in TMZ must stand for Trump.
        TMZ should handle the republican party, especially Trump.
        We live in a time where winning means everything. Lies trump the truth. Trump reflects that.
        We live in a time where entertainment value exceeds informative value. America has chosen Netflix over the New York Times.
        America is acting like the giant baby that refuses to get out of the shopping cart.
        Blatant racism

        Simultaneously Gloriously & Painfully Transparent
        Not a politician
        Been there done that
        Lobbyists: Take away the artificial lines
        He's the guy these politicans report to

        Trump's arrival is a payment of sins of American's exhaustion from dealing with politicians. People like him because he has no filter and therefore unlike most politicians the average American believes he plays it politically incorrect AKA how normal people want to hear it.

        He's a master of making noise. The volume of attention. No press is bad press.
